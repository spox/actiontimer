  ~ Simple timing for a complex world ~

ActionTimer is a helper for timed events. It
allows for single and recurring actions to
be executed in an efficient manner. It makes
use of a single thread to keep time on registered
actions and uses an ActionPool to execute
actions. Simple and effective.

install (easy):

gem install ActionTimer

install (less easy):

git clone http://github.com/spox/actiontimer.git
cd actiontimer
gem build actiontimer.gemspec
gem install ActionTimer-x.x.x.gem

Simple example of using the timer:

require 'actiontimer'

timer = ActionTimer::Timer.new

timer.add(10){puts "#{Time.now}: This is timed every 10 seconds"}
timer.add(15){puts "#{Time.now}: This is timed every 15 seconds"}
loop do
    puts "#{Time.now}: Main loop that sleeps for 5 seconds"
    sleep(5)
end

Output:
