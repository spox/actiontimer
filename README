  ~ Simple timing for a complex world ~

ActionTimer is a helper for timed events. It
allows for single and recurring actions to
be executed in an efficient manner. It makes
use of a single thread to keep time on registered
actions and uses an ActionPool to execute
actions. Simple and effective.

Note: Still testing after moving to its own lib.
      Probably (most likely) still a few bugs that
      I should have fixed in the next day or so
